    <h1 id="topic-2">How to be a master in coding</h1>
    <p>Coding is one of the most important skills you can learn in the 21st century. It is a valuable skill for both your personal and professional life. If you can code, you can create your own apps and websites, automate tasks, and even start your own business.
        <p>Here is a video from the YouTube channel Tim KIm, which lists the top 10 coding skills to learn in 2023:</p>
        <iframe id="topic-2" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WR1ydijTx5E?si=KxTjMp_JVySH00tx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="iframe-center"></iframe>
        <p>Tim Kim's video "How I Learned to Code in 4 Months & Got a Job! (No CS Degree, No Bootcamp)" is a great inspiration for anyone who wants to learn to code. Kim shares his personal story of how he went from being a college dropout with zero technical skills to landing a software developer job in just 4 months.

            <p>Kim's advice is simple but effective:</p>
            
            <p>Focus on learning the fundamentals of coding. Don't get bogged down in learning all the latest and greatest technologies. Instead, focus on learning the core concepts of programming, such as variables, functions, loops, and data structures.
            Be consistent with your learning. It's better to study for a little bit every day than to cram for a few hours once a week. Set aside some time each day to practice coding, even if it's just for 30 minutes.
            Build projects. The best way to learn to code is by building projects. This will help you apply what you're learning and see it in action. Start with small projects, such as a simple calculator or website. As you gain more experience, you can start working on more complex projects.
            Kim also emphasizes the importance of networking with other developers. Once you have a basic understanding of coding, start reaching out to other developers and asking for their advice and mentorship. Networking can help you learn new things, find job opportunities, and build a community of support.
            
            Overall, Tim Kim's video is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn to code. His advice is simple, effective, and actionable. If you're serious about learning to code, I highly recommend watching his video.</p>
            
            <p>Here are some additional thoughts on Kim's video: </p>
            
            <p>Kim's approach to learning to code is very self-directed. He didn't attend a coding bootcamp or take any formal classes. Instead, he learned to code by reading books and articles, watching online tutorials, and working on personal projects. This approach is not for everyone, but it can be a great way to learn to code if you're self-motivated and disciplined.
            Kim also emphasizes the importance of failure. He says that he failed many times while he was learning to code. But he never gave up. He kept practicing and learning from his mistakes. This is an important lesson for anyone who wants to learn to code. Everyone makes mistakes, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep learning and improving.
            Finally, Kim's video is a reminder that it is possible to learn to code and get a job in the tech industry without a computer science degree or a coding bootcamp. It takes hard work and dedication, but it is possible. If you're interested in learning to code, I encourage you to watch Tim Kim's video and start your journey today.</p></p>

    <h1 id="topic-3">Can you work from anywhere in the world if you're in IT?</h1>
    <p>One of the biggest benefits of working in IT is the flexibility it offers. Many IT jobs can be done remotely, which means that you can work from anywhere in the world. This can be a great option for people who want to travel or live in different places. <p>Sam Kern's TEDxHieronymusPark talk on the surprising power of remote work is an inspiring and thought-provoking look at the benefits of remote work for both individuals and organizations. Kern argues that remote work is not just about flexibility and work-life balance, but also about creativity, productivity, and innovation.</p> <p> 
        
        Kern begins by sharing his own story of how he transitioned from a traditional office job to a remote job. He describes how remote work allowed him to travel the world, pursue his passions, and be more productive. He also shares stories from other remote workers who have experienced similar benefits.
        
        Kern then goes on to discuss the research on remote work. He cites studies that show that remote workers are often more productive and engaged than their office-based counterparts. He also discusses the benefits of remote work for organizations, such as reduced costs and increased employee retention.
        
        Kern concludes his talk by arguing that remote work is the future of work. He believes that remote work will allow us to live and work more freely and creatively. He also believes that remote work will help us to solve some of the world's biggest challenges, such as climate change and poverty.

    </p>
    <p>
        My thoughts on Kern's talk
    </p>
    <p>
        I agree with Kern that remote work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. I believe that remote work can help us to create a more equitable and sustainable world.

        I am particularly interested in Kern's point about the relationship between remote work and creativity. I believe that remote work can help us to tap into our full potential as creative beings. When we are free to work from anywhere, we are less constrained by traditional office environments and we are more likely to be inspired by our surroundings.

        I am also encouraged by Kern's discussion of the benefits of remote work for organizations. I believe that remote work can help organizations to attract and retain top talent, and it can also help organizations to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

        Overall, I think that Kern's talk is a valuable contribution to the conversation about remote work. I encourage everyone to watch it, especially if you are considering working remotely or if you are an employer who is considering offering remote work to your employees.

    <h1 id="topic-4">How to work effectively in a Team</h1>
    <p>
        Chris White's TEDxAtlanta talk on how to create a work culture that brings out the best in employees is a must-watch for any leader. White argues that by unblocking communication, becoming responsive, and aiming higher, leaders can harness all of the energy and creativity that employees have to offer.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Unblock communication
    </p>
    <p>
        White begins by talking about the importance of unblocking communication in the workplace. He argues that leaders need to create an environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up and sharing their ideas. This means being open to feedback, even if it is negative. It also means being willing to listen to employees and take their concerns seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
        Become responsive
    </p>
    <p>
        White also emphasizes the importance of being responsive to employees. He argues that leaders need to be quick to respond to emails, phone calls, and other communications from employees. This shows that leaders value employees' time and input. It also helps to build trust and rapport between leaders and employees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aim higher
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, White encourages leaders to aim higher for their teams. He argues that leaders should set ambitious goals and challenge their employees to achieve them. This helps to motivate employees and keep them engaged in their work.
    </p>
    <iframe id="topic-4" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2y8SA6cLUys?si=h2p3U11Nm7r0oND1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="iframe-center"></iframe><p>I agree with White that communication, responsiveness, and ambition are essential for creating a work culture that brings out the best in employees. I believe that leaders who focus on these areas will be able to create teams that are more productive, innovative, and successful.

        I particularly like White's emphasis on unblocking communication. I believe that it is important for employees to feel comfortable speaking up and sharing their ideas, even if they are different from the leader's ideas. This is how leaders can learn new things and make better decisions.
        
        I also like White's advice about being responsive to employees. I believe that employees appreciate it when leaders take the time to listen to them and respond to their concerns. This shows that leaders value employees and care about their well-being.
        
        Finally, I agree with White that leaders should aim higher for their teams. I believe that employees are more motivated and engaged when they are working towards ambitious goals. Leaders can help employees to achieve their full potential by setting challenging goals and providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed.
        
        Overall, I think that White's talk is a valuable resource for leaders who want to create a work culture that brings out the best in their employees. I encourage all leaders to watch it.</p></div>
